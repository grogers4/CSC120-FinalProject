# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

Turn limit:
Every time the player enters a command (whether it works or not), there is a turn counter which increases by 1. If the number of turns reaches 100, the player will lose the game.

Entering kitchen:
The kitchen door is initially locked, so it can only be entered through the basement, which can only be accessed by entering the laundry chute ("chute") from upstairs. Player must shrink before they can enter the laundry chute.
Once in the kitchen, the player cannot get out of the kitchen/basement without the kitchen being unlocked by the housekeeper. For this to happen, you must possess the wood stove, which will draw the attention of the housekeeper who then leaves the door between the kitchen and dining room open.

Getting recipe:
The object of this game is to get the housekeeper to make a soup recipe that was special to the ghost before dying. The recipe is enclosed in an envelope with the mail in the entryway. To make the recipe available, the player needs to drop the yarn in the living room, which will cause the cat to chase after the yarn, then tear open the letter to reveal the recipe. 
In order for the housekeeper to find the recipe, the player needs to possess the piano in the living room after the cat has revealed the recipe. The housekeeper will enter the living room when the piano is possessed and see the recipe, which he will take.

Making soup:
In order to end the game, the player must get the housekeeper to enter the kitchen after he has the recipe. To do this the player must possess the wood stove, which will do that same thing as if it is being done without the recipe, but when the player unpossesses the stove, the housekeeper will return with ingredients for the soup and begin cooking, and the game will be won.
